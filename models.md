## Models & Implementations ðŸ¤–

- **[Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)**: A powerful open-source OCR engine developed by Google. It supports multiple languages and provides an easy-to-use command-line interface as well as APIs for integration with Python and other programming languages.
  
- **[LayoutLM](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlm)**: An advanced model for document understanding that captures both text and layout information in documents. It utilizes transformers and is particularly effective for document-level tasks such as form understanding, information extraction, and classification.
  
- **[Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)**: A modular object detection library developed by Facebook AI Research. Detectron2 is widely used for document layout analysis and complex object detection tasks, providing high flexibility and powerful implementations for layout parsing.
  
- **[TrOCR](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/trocr)**: A Transformer-based OCR model with pre-trained language models. It combines the strengths of transformers with traditional OCR pipelines to improve the recognition of both handwritten and printed text in document images.
  
- **[DocFormer](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/docformer)**: A transformer-based model designed for end-to-end document understanding. It integrates text, vision, and layout features to comprehensively understand the document structure and extract meaningful insights.

## 3. FUNSD
**Description**:  
The FUNSD (Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents) dataset is designed for form understanding, particularly focusing on key-value pair extraction. It consists of noisy scanned documents with annotations for semantic entities such as questions, answers, and headers, providing a challenging benchmark for information extraction from forms.

- **Size**: 199 forms  
- **Annotations**: Key-value pairs, semantic entities  
- **Use Cases**: Form understanding, key-value pair extraction, information extraction

## 4. IAM Handwriting Dataset
**Description**:  
The IAM Handwriting Dataset is a widely used dataset for handwritten text recognition, featuring forms of handwritten English text. Each form has been segmented into lines and words, with transcriptions provided for each segment, making it ideal for OCR and handwriting recognition tasks.

- **Size**: 1,539 scanned pages  
- **Annotations**: Line and word transcriptions  
- **Use Cases**: Handwritten text recognition, OCR, handwritten document processing

## 5. DIBCO
**Description**:  
The Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets focus on document image binarization challenges. Each dataset includes document images with various degrees of degradation, and the task is to binarize these images for improved readability and OCR performance. DIBCO is considered a benchmark for document image enhancement.

- **Size**: Varies by year  
- **Annotations**: Ground truth binarized images  
- **Use Cases**: Document image binarization, image enhancement

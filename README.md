## Introduction

Document understanding is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses various techniques from natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and machine learning to enable the extraction, classification, and interpretation of information from structured and unstructured documents. From traditional OCR systems to modern deep learning-based approaches, this repository covers the latest advancements and resources to accelerate your research or projects in this domain.

## Core Concepts

- **Document Layout Analysis**: Techniques to segment and analyze document layouts (e.g., paragraphs, images, tables).
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Methods for recognizing and extracting text from scanned documents or images.
- **Information Extraction**: Techniques to extract structured information from unstructured documents.
- **Document Image Enhancement**: Methods to preprocess and enhance document images (e.g., binarization, skew correction).
- **Document Classification**: Categorizing documents into predefined classes or identifying document types.
- **Table and Form Understanding**: Analyzing and extracting structured data from complex tables or forms.
